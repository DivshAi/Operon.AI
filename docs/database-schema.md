# AI Agentic Platform - Database Schema Design

## Overview
This document outlines the database schema for the AI Agentic Platform. The schema is designed to support all core features including user management, agent creation, team assembly, and prompt library functionality.

## Database Technologies
The platform uses SQLModel with SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production environments.

## Core Entities and Relationships

The database schema consists of the following main entities:

1. **User** - Represents platform users with different personas
2. **Agent** - Represents individual AI agents with configuration details
3. **Team** - Represents groups of agents working together
4. **Prompt** - Represents prompt templates with versioning and tagging capabilities

### User Entity

The User entity stores information about platform users:

- id: Unique identifier (UUID)
- email: Unique email address for authentication
- hashed_password: Password hash for secure authentication
- full_name: User's full name
- user_persona: Type of user persona (Individual Developer, Enterprise Team, DevOps Engineer, Product Manager, Platform Admin, Customer Admin)
- is_active: Boolean flag indicating if the account is active
- is_superuser: Boolean flag indicating if the user has admin privileges
- created_at: Timestamp when the user was created
- updated_at: Timestamp when the user was last updated

### Agent Entity

The Agent entity stores information about AI agents:

- id: Unique identifier (UUID)
- name: Name of the agent
- description: Description of the agent's purpose
- config: JSON configuration for the agent
- owner_id: Foreign key referencing the User who owns this agent
- created_at: Timestamp when the agent was created
- updated_at: Timestamp when the agent was last updated

### Team Entity

The Team entity stores information about teams of agents:

- id: Unique identifier (UUID)
- name: Name of the team
- description: Description of the team's purpose
- members: JSON array of agent IDs that belong to this team
- owner_id: Foreign key referencing the User who owns this team
- created_at: Timestamp when the team was created
- updated_at: Timestamp when the team was last updated

### Prompt Entity

The Prompt entity stores prompt templates with versioning capabilities:

- id: Unique identifier (UUID)
- body: The actual prompt content
- version: Version number of the prompt
- tags: JSON array of tags for categorizing prompts
- owner_id: Foreign key referencing the User who owns this prompt
- created_at: Timestamp when the prompt was created
- updated_at: Timestamp when the prompt was last updated
- audit_log: JSON field containing audit trail information

## Relationships

- One User can own multiple Agents (One-to-Many)
- One User can own multiple Teams (One-to-Many)
- One User can own multiple Prompts (One-to-Many)
- An Agent can belong to multiple Teams (Many-to-Many through a junction table)
- A Prompt can have multiple versions (Through versioning in the prompt body and audit_log)

## Indexes and Constraints

- Primary keys on all entities (id fields)
- Unique constraint on email field in User entity
- Foreign key constraints for relationships between entities
- Timestamp indexes for efficient querying of recent records

## Data Security and Compliance

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Audit logs are maintained for all data modifications
- Access controls are implemented through user roles and permissions
- Data retention policies are enforced to ensure compliance with GDPR, SOC2, and other frameworks
