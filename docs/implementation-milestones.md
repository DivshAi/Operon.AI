# AI Agentic Platform - Implementation Milestones

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation approach for building the AI Agentic Platform. The implementation is divided into logical milestones to ensure systematic development and testing.

## Phase 1: Monorepo Setup
### Goals
- Create project structure with clear separation of frontend, backend, and deployment components
- Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore configuration
- Set up documentation templates for user guides and API references

### Deliverables
- Root folder with /backend, /frontend, /deployment directories
- Initial project structure with README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Documentation templates for user guides and API references
- Basic project initialization scripts

## Phase 2: Backend Scaffolding
### Goals
- Implement core backend functionality using FastAPI
- Create database models with SQLModel
- Set up authentication system with JWT
- Develop CRUD endpoints for all core entities

### Deliverables
- FastAPI application with JWT middleware and role-based access controls
- Database models (User, Agent, Team, Prompt) with proper fields
- Authentication routes (register/login) with user persona management
- CRUD endpoints for agents, teams, and prompts with validation
- Service layer for orchestrator logic and prompt store functionality
- Configuration loading and validation system
- Structured logging implementation

## Phase 3: Frontend Scaffolding
### Goals
- Create responsive frontend with Next.js and TypeScript
- Implement authentication flows
- Build core UI components for platform features
- Develop dashboard and management interfaces

### Deliverables
- Next.js application with TypeScript support
- Authentication forms (login, register) with personalized onboarding
- Dashboard overview page with performance metrics
- Agent configuration UI with drag-and-drop functionality
- Team management interfaces
- Prompt repository with versioning tools
- Reusable UI components (AgentCard, TeamPanel, PromptCard)
- API client with JWT interceptor and error handling

## Phase 4: Containerization
### Goals
- Implement Docker-based deployment
- Create docker-compose configuration for local development
- Set up backup and restore scripts
- Implement caching strategies for performance optimization

### Deliverables
- Dockerfile.backend and Dockerfile.frontend with multi-stage builds
- docker-compose.yml with backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL services
- .env.example with comprehensive environment variable documentation
- Backup and restore scripts for containerized environments
- Caching strategies implementation (Redis/Memcached)

## Phase 5: Kubernetes Deployment
### Goals
- Create production-ready Kubernetes manifests
- Implement monitoring and logging configurations
- Set up service mesh patterns for observability and security

### Deliverables
- deployment/backend-deployment.yaml with horizontal pod autoscaling
- deployment/frontend-deployment.yaml with SSL termination and rate limiting
- deployment/postgres-statefulset.yaml with persistent volumes and backup strategies
- Monitoring and logging configurations for Kubernetes environments
- Service mesh patterns implementation for better observability and security

## Phase 6: CI/CD with GitHub Actions
### Goals
- Implement automated testing and building pipeline
- Set up continuous deployment process
- Add security scanning and code coverage reports

### Deliverables
- .github/workflows/ci.yml with lint, test, build images workflow
- .github/workflows/cd.yml with push to container registry and kubectl apply
- Automated performance testing integration
- Security checks in CI pipeline
- Blue-green deployment strategies implementation

## Phase 7: Monitoring & Logging
### Goals
- Implement comprehensive monitoring solution
- Set up logging infrastructure for debugging and analysis
- Create dashboards for key metrics and performance indicators

### Deliverables
- Prometheus metrics exposure in FastAPI with custom agent performance metrics
- Grafana dashboard JSON snippet with pre-configured panels
- Sentry initialization in both backend and frontend with error grouping and alerting
- Structured logging with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Centralized logging implementation with ELK stack or similar

## Implementation Timeline
Each phase should be completed sequentially, with thorough testing and validation before moving to the next phase. The total development timeline is approximately 12-16 weeks depending on team size and resources.

## Quality Assurance
- Code reviews for all implementations
- Automated testing coverage of at least 80%
- Security scanning integrated into CI pipeline
- Performance benchmarks established in each phase
- User acceptance testing for each milestone
