# AI Agentic Platform - Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and design of the AI Agentic Platform. The platform is designed as a scalable, secure, and extensible system that supports AI agent creation, management, and execution in both local and cloud environments.

## System Architecture
The application follows a tiered architecture pattern with clear separation between frontend, backend, and data layers. The system is built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

### High-Level Architecture

The AI Agentic Platform consists of the following main components:

1. **Frontend Layer** - Built with Next.js (React + TypeScript) for a responsive and interactive user experience
2. **Backend Layer** - Powered by Python FastAPI with RESTful endpoints for API communication
3. **Data Layer** - Utilizes SQLModel with SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production environments
4. **LLM Integration Layer** - Supports both local LLMs via Ollama and cloud-hosted LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure)
5. **Infrastructure Layer** - Containerized with Docker + docker-compose and deployable to Kubernetes clusters
6. **Monitoring & Logging** - Integrated with Prometheus, Grafana, and Sentry for comprehensive observability

### Component Interactions

The system follows a client-server architecture where:

- The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API endpoints
- The backend interacts with the database layer for data persistence
- The backend interfaces with LLM services (both local and cloud) for agent execution
- The monitoring system collects metrics from all components for performance analysis

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for HTTP requests
- SWR for data fetching and caching
- React Icons for UI components

### Backend Technologies
- Python FastAPI
- SQLModel (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- JWT-based authentication
- Ollama-py or subprocess for local LLM integration
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure SDKs for cloud LLM integration

### Infrastructure Technologies
- Docker and docker-compose for containerization
- Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboard visualization
- Sentry for error tracking and alerting
- Structured logging with correlation IDs for distributed tracing

## Security Considerations

The platform implements comprehensive security measures including:
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Role-based access controls (RBAC) for different user personas
- Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting and API throttling to prevent abuse
- Audit logging for compliance (GDPR, SOC2)

## Scalability & Performance

The architecture is designed with scalability in mind:
- Containerized deployment allows for horizontal scaling
- Kubernetes support enables auto-scaling and load balancing
- Caching strategies (Redis/Memcached) for performance optimization
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local development with SQLite database
- Docker containers for consistent local environments

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Horizontal pod autoscaling for backend services
- SSL termination and rate limiting at ingress level

## Data Flow

1. User authentication via JWT tokens
2. Frontend requests data through RESTful API endpoints
3. Backend validates requests and interacts with database
4. For agent execution, backend fetches prompts and interfaces with LLM services
5. Results are returned to frontend for display
6. Monitoring systems collect metrics and logs throughout the process
