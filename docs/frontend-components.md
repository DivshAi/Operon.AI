# AI Agentic Platform - Frontend Components Design

## Overview
This document outlines the core frontend components for AI Agentic Platform. The platform's user interface is built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript to provide a responsive, accessible, and performant experience.

## Component Architecture

### Core UI Components

#### 1. AuthContext Provider (`pages/_app.tsx`)
- Provides authentication context throughout the application
- Manages user persona detection and role-based UI components
- Handles JWT token management and automatic refresh
- Implements protected route access control

#### 2. Authentication Pages
- `pages/login.tsx` - Login form with JWT authentication
- `pages/register.tsx` - Registration form with personalized onboarding flows based on user personas

#### 3. Dashboard Components
- `pages/dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard showing overview of agents, teams, health status, and prompt repository status
- Includes performance metrics and quick actions for common operations

#### 4. Agent Management Components
- `pages/agents/[id].tsx` - Detailed agent configuration UI with drag-and-drop interface for agent assembly
- `components/AgentCard.tsx` - Reusable card component for displaying agent information
- Agent configuration forms with validation

#### 5. Team Management Components
- `pages/teams/[id].tsx` - Team configuration UI with drag-and-drop interfaces for agent assembly
- `components/TeamPanel.tsx` - Panel component for team management and visualization

#### 6. Prompt Management Components
- `pages/prompts/index.tsx` - List, search, and filter prompts by tag/version with version comparison tools
- `pages/prompts/[promptId].tsx` - View/edit versions, change tags, audit history with real-time preview capabilities
- `components/PromptCard.tsx` - Reusable card component for displaying prompt information

#### 7. Navigation Components
- Main navigation bar with role-based menu items
- Sidebar navigation for different sections of the platform
- Breadcrumb navigation for complex pages

### UI Design Principles

#### Responsive Design
All components are built with responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS:
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Adaptive components for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interfaces

#### Accessibility
Components follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

#### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting for lazy loading
- Component memoization where appropriate
- Efficient rendering patterns
- Image optimization techniques

## Component Interactions

### Data Flow
1. Authentication context provides user information to all components
2. API client (`lib/api.ts`) handles HTTP requests with JWT interceptor
3. Data is fetched using SWR for caching and revalidation
4. Components update based on data changes and user interactions

### State Management
- Global state managed through React Context API
- Local component state for UI-specific interactions
- Form state management with validation
- Error handling and display throughout the application

- Supports quick edit and version comparison

## API Integration

### Axios Instance (`lib/api.ts`)
- Configured with JWT interceptor for automatic token inclusion
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Request/response interceptors for logging and transformation

## User Persona Specific UI

### Individual Developers
- Simplified interface focused on rapid prototyping
- Quick start guides and tutorials
- Code snippets and examples

### Enterprise Teams

- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Responsive design testing across device sizes

### Performance Testing
- Bundle size optimization
- Rendering performance monitoring
- Load testing of complex components
